# Accordion

This is a simple demo of how to implement an accordion using the jQuery UI library. The accordion allows users to expand and collapse sections of content.

## Installation

To use this code, simply download the folder and open `index.html` in your web browser.`main.js` will initialize the Accordion on the element with the ID "accordion". To customize the accordion, you can modify the options passed to the `accordion` function in the JavaScript code. For example, you can change the event that triggers the accordion to open, or change the height style of the sections.

## Usage

To use the accordion, click on the section headers to expand or collapse the content. The accordion is set up to only allow one section to be open at a time. To close all sections, click on the currently open section header.
